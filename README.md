# Smoothie-Recommendation
I have created a web application based on my experience at Jugo Juice.
A lot of customers have difficulties reading the menu due to bright colours on the background along with bright coloured of smoothie titles. It eventually leads the customers to ask questions regarding the size and cost of the smoothies rather than reading through the menu for the decision. 
When the store gets crowded, however, I have realized that I spend more time taking questions of customers than making smoothies. The inefficiency of this action causes the customers on the line to leave for different menu. 

To maximize the time efficieny of taking orders and serving smoothies, I created a web application that is linkable through QR code. By scanning the QR code via the camera, the customer would have access to the website that consist of 6 most popular smoothies at Jugo Juice along with its ingridients, price and short description. 

The launch of the QR code assissted customers on deciding what smoothie they are getting as well as shortened the time of customers asking question which eventually led the workers to focus more on making and serving the smoothie and taking more customers.
